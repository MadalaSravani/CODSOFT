I successfully completed a Codsoft internship in "Web Development" by creating three tasks using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The first task was creating a "Portfolio" using HTML and CSS.

The second task was creating a "Landing Page" using HTML and CSS, for which I created "Explore the Globe."

The last task was creating a "Calculator" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
